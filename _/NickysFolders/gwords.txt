The word BICYCLE appears around the top of the box in red.  &nbsp;  The death cards made an appearance again during Desert Storm. Because the entire war was over in 100 hours there was no point in using them on the enemy. Instead, they were made up as calling cards and personal mementos of the units involved in the war. United States Playing Card has been making cards for the military for nearly a century. Remember those Vietnam-era images of soldiers tucking the Ace of Spades in their helmets? U.S. Playing Card made entire decks of the aces because they were believed to inspire fear among enemy fighters. Similar decks were reissued in Operation Desert Shield, but more as a tradition than as a psy-ops weapon. This is a standard Bicycle ace of spades produced by the company and shipped to the troops about to take part in the Persian Gulf War. It looks exactly like a standard playing card, except at the lower center they have printed the words Desert Shield. Desert Shield was the name of the operation during the defensive phase of the war when the Coalition was building up its forces in Saudi Arabia. The operation was changed to Desert Storm when the Coalition went on the offensive. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Playing Card Company produced entire decks of the Ace of Spades for combat troops in Vietnam. They were sent free of charge in a box called Secret Weapon. Those decks were not marked Vietnam since this was never done before. During Operation Desert Shield, however, Bicycle again produced the decks in new packaging and typeface to distinguish the Vietnam and Desert Shield decks. The Desert Shield decks are clearly marked Desert Shield. Again, these decks were supplied to U.S. troops free of charge.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;      	http://www.merz67.com/resize/images/bicycle desert shield ace spades b.jpg?lr=t&bw=250		Bicycle Playing Cards > Bicycle Playing Cards	13.4500	79	new	2014-09-12	0.2500 lb	Bicycle US Playing Card	705105872858	705105872858	in stock	Toys & Games > Games > Card Games > Traditional Playing Cards

http://www.merz67.com/store/p/1021-Caesar-III.aspx?feed=Froogle	Caesar III	      Caesar IIISierra  As a provincial governor charged with spreading the glory of Rome your mission is clear; build cities, foster trade and industry, make money.&nbsp;How you accomplish this entirely up to you. Gain wealth and power, make a career out of pleasing the emperor, battle Barbarians and repel invaders or concentrate on building the next Eternal City. Fail and you'll end up as lunch for the lions. Prove your strength of mind and spirit and you just may be crowned Caesar!  Build, rule, and defend on one screen - no more switching between city, province, and battle screens.   Use the City Construction Kit to build the perfect city, or climb the ladder of Roman politics with a career.   Now your citizens can give you a glimpse into the life of the common man - talk to them for clues about how to improve your city.   Appease 5 gods with temples and festivals. Each god has its own sphere of influence; Please Ceres and your crops will thrive. But dishonor Neptune and watch your trade ships sink into the sea.   Various new structures and challenges arise throughout your governor's career, for tremendous depth of play and replay-ability.   A truly intuitive, helpful interface let's you jump right in and start building.   Players of Caesar III are immersed in a city simulation set in the age of the ancient Roman Empire. Players place buildings on previously empty terrain and construct a city. These buildings come to life, and the city begins to evolve. As the city grows, it encounters various problems which must be overcome. Players have specific objectives to achieve, although many players will not use these, but rather will content themselves in designing their idea of the perfect city.   The game is structured as a career, beginning with a training mission, and then progressing through a series of ever tougher real assignments. Each mission/assignment consists of a province and set objectives. Achieving these objectives will result in promotion and an offer of a tougher assignment, which can be turned down if the player is having too much fun to accept at that time.   The career progression allows us to introduce elements of the game step by step, thereby teaching players how to play without forcing them to play through something called a tutorial. This technique has been extremely well-used in games such as Warcraft.   There will also be a City Construction Kit option, where players ignore the career progression, and simply play the full game with no promotion involved.

All hunting areas are created from USGS terrain data. The landscapes are accurately depicted in the game, based on their true environments.

http://www.merz67.com/store/p/1172-Pinnacle-Instant-Video-Album.aspx?feed=Froogle	Pinnacle Instant Video Album	    Pinnacle Instant VideoAlbum   While advanced video makers are still waiting for an affordable, truly professional DVD authoring program to appear, there's no shortage of options for the absolute novice. Pinnacle's Instant VideoAlbum is affordable and accessible, but haven't we seen it somewhere before?   Regardless of how many DVD burners come bundled with Sonic Solutions' MyDVD, the real fight in the entry-level DVD authoring market appears to be between Pinnacle and Ulead. Ulead's DVD MovieFactory is a very neat and simple tool for quickly making DVD and VCD discs from video files. Pinnacle's equivalent has, until recently, been a program called Expression - now part of the InstantCD/DVD bundle (review, p50). But, along with the introduction of InstantCD/DVD, Pinnacle is introducing a new beginner's DVD authoring program - Instant VideoAlbum.A new faceAt first glance, Instant VideoAlbum looks significantly different from Expression - the stylish Studio-family graphic interface is replaced by something much more basic and functional. And, rather than having the three-step workflow of capture, author and burn, VideoAlbum takes a four-step approach, separating design and previewing into separate stages. Aside from the visual makeover, however, not much seems to have changed.The capture interface features a large video monitor with buttons for controlling playback of camcorders or decks connected via FireWire. Users can choose to make a DVD, SVCD or VCD disc, and MPEG encoding settings can be chosen from presets - with Automatic, Good or Best options - or manually, choosing a target bitrate between 3,000 and 8,000Kbit/s. When capture from a DV device is selected, a dialogue box appears, asking users to specify a name and target directory for the files being imported. Annoyingly, this box doesn't vanish when capture begins - it remains on screen, showing a progress indicator and providing a Stop Import button, but also partially obscuring the video display. Scene-detection is provided, based on changes in time and date stamp for DV material.ConclusionEven though Instant VideoAlbum is closely based on Expression, the changes Pinnacle has made to the video editing tools point it at a significantly different market. While Expression is intended for quick and dirty burning of edited material, Instant VideoAlbum is focused more on a simple transfer from tape to disc. Users can make a disc with the order and structure of their camcorder tapes, but without the boring repetitive landscapes, embarrassing mishaps or long waiting-for-something-to-happen pauses that always seem to find their way into home movies when you play them back. It's hardly an inspiring stepping stone into the world of video production, but even we have to concede that some people just aren't that interested in video editing. And for those strange, misguided fools, this program is highly recommended!

It gives you the opportunity to identify and correct your weak areas as well as playing to your strengths. This better balance makes you more widely employable and enhances your job satisfaction.

This is my favorite, said our 5 year-old tester because he makes such silly things.&nbsp; In the Shape Shack, users are given 6 objects, and asked to sort them into two categories, based on some common characteristic, such as color or shape. These sorting skills can then be built on by a Pattern Parade that challenges kids to listen and construct patterns of parade members. Finally, the Counting Club presents kids the chance to count along with an assortment of forest creatures.  * Builds essential preschool skills with letters, numbers, shapes, and patterns. * Encourages learning through several senses-seeing, hearing, and moving. * Provides four levels of play in five interactive activities.

http://www.merz67.com/store/p/1344-The-Saboteur.aspx?feed=Froogle	The Saboteur	  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Saboteur  There have plenty of World War II games over the years, but none with the intrigue and danger of The Saboteur. As Irishman Sean Devlin you must fight back against the Nazi occupation of Paris, working with British Intelligence and the French Resistance to pave the way for D-Day.  Explore an open world recreation of wartime Paris and fight to free the city, with newly liberated districts turning from black and white to colour as the strength of the occupying forces weakens. Only by inspiring the civilians' will to fight can you begin to turn the tide, as you assassinate German officials and sabotage equipment, vehicles and buildings.  The closer you get to final victory the more help you'll have, but for many missions you must rely on your own stealth tactics and combat skills. As you clamber across rooftops and make use of the intuitive cover system, you can help win WWII from a very different perspective.  Key Features     Resistance is not futile: Stealth, action and '40s chic combine in a unique take on World War II warfare that's inspired by true events and people.   Colour of victory: Watch liberated districts burst into colour, as you fight to free a city where Nazi symbols are the only things not in black and white.   Assassin's creed: Use your stealth skills to assassinate the Nazis responsible for killing your friends, as you race across rooftops and use cover to strike without being seen.   Weapons of war: Collect and utilise a wide range of weapons and explosives to help your missions or commandeer enemy vehicles to complete your goals.   Power to the people: Inspire the people with your victories and you can count on help from the Maquis, ordinary civilians and British Intelligence.   World War II games arent exactly thin on the ground, but there has never been one remotely like The Saboteur. Instead of sticking you on the front lines, it immerses you in an edgy, paranoid Paris, occupied by the Nazis, in which the Resistance is struggling to remain below the radar yet strike back at the oppressors. Take this delicious scenario and add Grand Theft Auto-style third-person, free-roaming action-adventure gameplay, then season it with some exceedingly clever visuals -- areas locked down by the Nazis are rendered in near-monochrome, with just the odd splash of colour  and you have a tasty dish indeed.   Vibrant colours abound, mind you, as proceedings kick off: the war hasnt yet started, and you find yourself playing Sean Devlin, a devil-may-care Irishman who is a race-car mechanic and budding driver. A race on the eve of the war brings you into contact with your nemesis, high-ranking Nazi Kurt Dierker, who murders your best mate Jules; as war erupts, you rescue Jules sister Veronique and your mentor Vittore, pitching up in Paris at a house of ill-repute called the Belle de Nuit.  Which is where the fun really starts. A now cynical, hard-bitten Devlin, seeking to avenge Jules and look after the impulsive Veronique, falls in with the French Resistance and, through British old flame Skylar Sinclair British Intelligence, and carries out increasingly risky missions for both organisations, as well as other wings of the Resistance, priests and all sorts of others. The Saboteur is a meaty game with vast numbers of missions and side-missions; those involving the Resistance and British Intelligence advance the story, though.  Open-world action-adventure games are all about systems which determine how the world operates and in that respect, The Saboteur is state-of-the-art. The key system is Suspicion  the Nazis occupying Paris were famously paranoid, and if any of them spot you doing anything untoward, they will blow whistles to sound the alarm. At which point you will be swamped by the blighters.  Its lucky, then, that Devlin has stealth abilities  when he bloodlessly executes Nazis, he can don their uniforms and creep around. And he can scale buildings, and thus approach unexpectedly from the rooftops. Escaping from suspicion involves distancing yourself from pursuers or finding a hiding-place. The weaponry is pleasingly exotic, including scoped sniper-rifles and RPGs; ammo is plentiful. A Contraband system acts as currency, which you can exchange for useful items with spivvy black marketers (who also assign you side-missions). The cars are great, too, and you get free access to any youve stolen once you have driven them back to one of many secure garages dotted around the city. A period soundtrack ratchets up the pungent atmosphere.  The aspect of The Saboteur which really stands out, though, is its missions: they ramp up before long to a truly spectacular level, and take in all manner of exotic locations, such as a Zeppelin or the Louvre. Impressively, you never feel that you have to take a specific approach although, in general, stealth is best employed unless there are only a few enemies in the vicinity. The story and characters impress, too, with more depth than we are used to finding in games  Skylar flirts incorrigibly with Devlin, for example, and Margot de Bonnaire, leader of one of the Resistance factions, is obsessed with wrestling Parisian artworks from the grip of the Nazis.  If the idea of enacting a GTA-style game in a stylised yet utterly believable Occupied Paris appeals to you (and how could it not?), then youre going to love The Saboteur.

http://www.merz67.com/store/p/1648-National-Geographic-Lost-City-of-Z-Hidden-Object-Game.aspx?feed=Froogle	National Geographic Lost City of Z Hidden Object Game	  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Lost City of Z?  THQ  Nat Geo Adventure: Lost City of Z is a single player, point-and-click PC game adventure based on the true to life mystery of the Amazonian Lost City of Z, the disappearance of a prominent explorer at the beginning of the last century, and National Geographic's television coverage of recent revelations surrounding the mystery. Game features include a merging of fictional characters and in-game action, with historical events and recent archeological discoveries, as well as exciting puzzle and hidden object gameplay.&nbsp;&nbsp;            In 1925, veteran British surveyor, archeologist and explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett journeyed to the Mato Grosso region of Brazil with a small crew to search for a lost civilization  what he referred to as the 'City of Z.' Neither he nor any in his party ever returned. Reported nearly two-hundred years earlier in a document penned by a Portuguese explorer, the lost City of Z, the suspected hub of an as of yet undiscovered large-scale civilization in what was assumed to always have been the sparsely populated inner Amazon region, was Fawcett's passion and obsession. His adventures and disappearance became the stuff of legend, inspiring everything from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World, to early Hollywood movies and in part, even the iconic adventures and person of Indiana Jones.   Story and GameplayThe historical Colonel Fawcett was quite aware of the dangers of his adventures, including disease, wild animals and the possibly fatal consequences of trespassing in the lands of native tribes. He even went so far as to request that no rescue party be sent if he did not return. In real-life this was ignored, and scores of people were lost over the years searching for Colonel Fawcett and/or the truth behind the legendary City of Z. The storyline of Nat Geo Adventure: Lost City of Z features the fictional account of one of these later expeditions, in this case lead by a modern National Geographic employee. Reported missing in the jungle for four days, its up to you to help find your National Geographic comrade and the truth behind the real Lost City of Z. To do so players use the game's point-and-click interaction mechanism to collect clues and hidden items found throughout the game environment, read maps and solve puzzles. In addition, players will engage in five mini-games and use their in-game camera and journal to document the wildlife, environments, artifacts and ruins that are encountered as they creep ever closer to finally solving the mystery of the Lost City of Z.   Key Game Features     Follow the clues left by Colonel Fawcett to lead you through the mysterious rainforest.   Play 5 exciting new mini-games to challenge clue solving skills.   Watch thrilling footage from the National Geographic chronicle of the Lost City of Z as seen on TV.   Take photographs of the beautiful scenes and wildlife around you and catalog them in your daily journal.   Single player, hidden object mystery, point-and-click adventure.   Educational and entertaining content and gameplay suitable for all ages. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Minimum Requirements:&nbsp; Pentium&nbsp;4 1.4&nbsp;GHz 100% compatible, 256 MB RAM,&nbsp;540 MB HD space,&nbsp;64 MB AGP DirectX 9 and T&amp;L compatible video accelerator card, DirectX 9.0c or later (included on CD), DirectX compatible sound card, Mouse, and CD-Rom drive.

http://www.merz67.com/store/p/2280-XLR8-Card-Game.aspx?feed=Froogle	XLR8 Card Game	  Product Features      Age range 7-12   Card Game Type: Educational   Math-based Card Game   Warning! Choking hazard, Small parts not for children under age 3  Product Description      XLR8TM is an exciting, math-based card game where the first player to reach 200 miles per hour wins! It is easy to learn and fun for the whole family! Each player is dealt 5 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to be used as the draw pile. Players should maintain 5 cards in their hand at all times until they hit Top Speed. Players do this by drawing after each turn. At the end of their turn, players must call out their current speed. To start the game, players place a card from their hand on the playing surface in front of them, face up. This is the Speed Pile. Players have their own active speed piles they are trying to increase to 200MPH. Players track their speed using their Speed-O-Meter by adjusting the wheel at the end of each turn. This process is repeated until someone reaches Top Speed, but players must try to avoid the Blow Out, Caution, and Pit Stop cards along the way! Start your engines, you are ready to play! Set includes 109 cards, including 6 multiplier cards, 6 spinning speed-o-meters, durable zippered storage bag for easy clean up, and bi-fold instructions. Some interesting findings were reported by a sample of boys and girls between 7-12 and their mothers who tested XLR8 over a two-week period. At the end of the testing they were surveyed and discussed the game. Overall, 62% said they would definitely buy or probably buy the game and 70% said that the value was very good! Also 78% of the children and mothers said the game was very or extremely fun! Mothers liked the durable zippered storage bag and felt it was very important for easy clean up and keeping all the parts together. A feature Dr. Toy has noticed is a good way to store game pieces. Also, mothers enjoyed the educational aspect of the game. Children at various age ranges could play the game. 	http://www.merz67.com/resize/Shared/images/Bicycle Playing Cards/xlr8.jpg?lr=t&bw=250		Bicycle Playing Cards > Bicycle Playing Cards	4.4500	2280	new	2014-09-12	0.6000 lb	Bicycle US Playing Card	73854015353	73854015353	in stock	Toys & Games > Games > Card Games > Traditional Playing Cards

The Robocycle deck takes U.S. Playing Card Co.'s familiar Bicycle design and gives it a decidedly electronic theme, with court cards and jokers transformed into robots and circuit board-like patterns on the card backs.The Robocycle black deck is slightly different than its blue-backed twin.

The first edition sold out in record time. The second edition is now available.    While the deck remains the same as the first edition, the box was redesigned to perfectly showcase Homer's original artistic vision. In fact, the new distressed metallic box resembles the original box after being worn down over several weeks in a jacket pocket - we just wanted to save you the time.    The box is made of paper 25% thicker than the Sentinel tuck case, and they are coated with a durable varnish. These cards protect themselves.    DeckONE features original illustration by Homer Liwag proudly on the box, the back design, the Jokers, the Ace of Spades, and even each court card. The Kings, Queens, and Jacks exude a unique patina.    The cards are printed in Q1 quality on the web casino press at USPCC. Available now in limited quantities. Like Homer's critically acclaimed DVD's CoinONE and CoinTWO - these will be in very high demand. Act now and stock up for the holiday season.    DeckOne's industrial inspiration draws from over 30 years of television and movie production design, concept art, and illustration. While sketching Bat Mobiles and Colonial Viper space ships as a kid in the 70's, Homer dreamed of designing props and ships for TV shows and movies.    I wanted the back design to appear heavy - like the giant otherworldly machines they depicted. For the case, I created the look of worn, military grade, black stamped steel by using thick metallic stock and subtle printing and embossing effects.    D1IE is the perfect union of Homer's formal training in Industrial Design and his passion for feature film conceptual art.

This highly collectable deck, (available in a VERY limited run of only 5000 units!), is certainly more restrained than previous Karnival designs. Indeed, the Karnival Elite Deck employs elaborate baroque patterning and delicate swirls on the back design and box. From the intricately designed tuckcase to the eye catching 'glow' on the pips of the spades and club cards (designed to make the values 'pop' from the card), this deck was created to be something that you would break out for a very special evening of entertainment... be it gambling, card magic or just plain showing off!

With both conscious and subconscious influences from the casino industry as well as my own visceral world I believe that I found something in the Rounders that represents who I am and what I stand for. I have always thought that everything beautiful is either intricate or simple, and I am drawn to the latter, especially in design. I have stayed true to that idea through every stage of the design and production of the Madison Rounders. I wanted to create a deck of cards that somehow reflected my style and ideals through simplicity. The Madison Rounders are beautifully minimal in design, they are bold and strong with only three colors used throughout. They host an Ace of Spades fit for any casino. With help from Jeff Lianza, Peter Mckinnon, the Ellusionist team and my closest friends, I am proud to present the Madison Rounders. ------DANIEL MADISON.	http://www.merz67.com/resize/images/rounders_black.jpg?lr=t&bw=250		Bicycle Playing Cards	8.7500	2689	new	2014-09-12	0.3500 lb	Ellusionist	ellround01	656103011902	in stock	Toys & Games > Games > Card Games > Traditional Playing Cards
